This part identifies the need for updating logging locations.

Start from version 2.0.5, we check the effectiveness of existing logging locations (result in "Validate" folders). If the updating is needed, we will determine which logging location can be kept. Based on that, then we suggest new logging locations ("WebLog", "Method", "Block" folders).

In our study, we find updatings are needed between version 2.0.5 and 2.0.6, and version 2.1.2 and 2.1.3. Since 2.0.x and 2.1.x are different branches, we suggest new logging locations for version 2.1.0 instead of comparing it with 2.0.x.
